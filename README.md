Non-Responsive Landing Page
This repository contains the source code and assets for a non-responsive landing page built using HTML and CSS. The landing page is a single-page website designed to provide information and promote a specific product, service, or event.

The non-responsive landing page is developed using only HTML and CSS, without the use of any responsive frameworks or JavaScript. It offers a basic and straightforward layout that remains fixed and does not adapt to different screen sizes or devices.
